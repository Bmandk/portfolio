**Roles:**
* Lead Game Designer

**Game Description**  
Pacha is an exploratory adventure game, set in a forest that is about to be cut down.
You play as Pacha, and at first your objective is to gather food for you and your cubs.
But you will quickly realize that humans are encroaching on your forest,
cutting down all the trees. You must stop them, and in the process become stronger.
Pacha can burrow into the ground, and then launch into the to overcome various obstacles.

**Project Description**  
Pacha was made by 17 people in seven weeks while attending <a href="http://www.dadiu.dk/">DADIU</a>.
We were a brand new team, having no experience as a team before. What I learned most
from this project was teamwork, having to work with other game designers, programmers,
a sound designer, quality assurance/user researchers, an art director, a game director,
and a producer. I learned about and used rational game design, one-pagers and prototypes
to design and communicate the game design. Since I was also the lead, I had also had
to have an overview of the other game designers, making sure we were doing the right
tasks, communicating a lot with the other departments, and generally keeping track of the overall design.

**Design Process**  
Development started out with a pre-production phase. The game director Lukas decided that Princess Mononoke and A Short Hike 
would be some of the main inspiration for the game. From those came his main pillars:

* Nature: The game should be about nature and the conflict between humans and nature.
* Non-gore: There should not be unnecessary violence in the game, and people shouldn't be dying.
* Fun: The gameplay in itself should be fun.

Lukas also had an idea that the main character should be some sort of creature. With this information and some refinement,
I organized a paper-prototyping session during the pre-production. We split into smaller groups, and during the day, each group
developed a small paper prototype with whatever game they wanted to make. This helped greatly shape the game, while also allowing
each member of the team to show what kind of game they wanted to make. We tried to take something from each prototype where it made sense.
One prototype had more high-level structure, while another focused on moment-to-moment gameplay. After the pre-production
we ended up with the below one-pager for the overall game.

The team was then able to use this to create the basics of the game. 3D artists had a general direction for the character, level design could be fueled by the map and gameloop, programmers had the main mechanics written down. I was also heavily involved in creating prototypes of the game.
I created prototypes early on, which showed the burrowing mechanic. As this was how the player was going to be moving around,
that is where we focused our attentions first. Below is a video of the prototypes, along with the final version of the game.

After the second prototype, we decided to focus completely on the burrowing mechanic and drop other ideas we had outlined in the original design, such as stealth and more in-depth combat abilities. The prototypes showed that the burrowing mechanic by itself was enough to be engaging to players. Players would play with them for quite a bit longer than first anticipated. Another reason for cutting the other mechanics was because of scope. Since we only had seven weeks for this game, we decided to focus more on this single mechanic instead.
That resulted in the following revised version of the one-pager.

This concluded the main contribution that the design team did. There is too much information to go through with this. Since I was also the lead game & level designer, I did not design everything about the game. All three designers were involved in the above process to some extent, and during production we all had responsibility for different areas.
However I wanted to create a culture of open feedback, where everyone from the team could give open feedback about anything in the game, which worked out great and made the game better.

During production we also worked with the user researchers on the team. They organized playtests and researched other games. This gave us very important insight into how to improve the game. One example is that we had a playtest just after completing the first iteration of the tutorial. It showed that it mostly worked, but there were no prompts on the screen 
to show which buttons the user can use. This caused some frustration in players, as they did not realize they could use a dash to destroy various obstacles. After adding prompts, 
players were immediately able to break the obstacle and continue on, later using the dash to destroy obstacles without giving much thought.

By working with The Attic to create Pacha, I learned a lot about game design, iteration, teamwork with other game designers, teamwork with other roles of a game production, and much more.

**How To Get It**  
The game can be downloaded <a href="https://dadiu.itch.io/pacha">on itch here</a>. The game supports both controller and mouse/keyboard, although controller is recommended.
