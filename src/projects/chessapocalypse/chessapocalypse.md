**Game Description**  
Chess Apocalypse is a small hyper-casual chess-based game. You control the king on
a chess board, and the computer will slowly spawn in chess pieces that try to kill you.
You are on a timer and must make your move quickly to not be captured.
Your goal is to capture the opponents pieces and survive as long as possible.
Each game can take anywhere from 10 seconds to 10 minutes.

**Project Description**  
Chess Apocalypse was a one-man project, with the goal of publishing a game.
The basic prototype was developed in a single day, with a week more of work to polish it up and finish it.
The core gameplay loop is so short, and the rules are easy to understand,
especially for anyone who has played chess before. However it still has a surprising amount of depth.
This makes it a great hyper-casual game.
The main goal then, was to publish the game. Since I only have access to an Android phone,
that was the only platform I could support. Publishing the game and sharing it with friends
was a very exciting experience. The game features both analytics, ads and remote config (e.g. changing 
game variables or turning features on/off without requiring an update), just like any modern GaaS game has.
My plans for the future are to add a couple more features, sounds, and then try to market the game via ads
or other sources. The game also fits well into the current trend of chess booming with both Twitch.tv
chess streamers and "The Queens Gambit" on Netflix.
