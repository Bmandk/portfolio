**Game Description**  
Wizard Smackdown was the first bigger game project I was a part of. The game was developed while
on exchange in Seattle, USA in October 2014. The game involves 2 wizards fighting each other on top
of a
very high pillar. To win you can use your spells to drain the opponent's health or push him
to the edge of the pillar.

**Project Description**  
The game was originally inspired after a Warcraft 3 mod called "Warlock". We had all enjoyed playing
it together, so we set out to recreate that. Creating a party game was also very feasible within the
month, as it doesn't require intricate systems or big levels/worlds for players to have fun with the
game. As we were creating a party game, we decided to go with controllers to play the game. We only
had Xbox controllers available, so we weren't able to test with different controllers. We still had
to figure out the control scheme to use. It was hard for us to decide internally, so we decided to
run playtests with the different versions. This worked well, as one control scheme seemed to be the
best and made it easy to choose. Spell design was another big part of the design. Players choose
their own spells at the start of the game, so we wanted all spells to be equally viable. We learned
quite quickly that it wasn't quite so simple. Firstly, changing one spell has an effect on other
spells, as playstyle and spell interaction also affects changes with spell changes. Secondly, in
hindsight I realized there is a lot more to balancing than just having 50% win rate. Fairness,
counterplay, enjoyment etc. all need to be taken into account.

The goal of the project was to learn how to work on a larger project. We were 6 people
working on it for a month full time, with 3 people working in the industry as supervisors.
To organize the work, we used Scrum to make sure right tasks were done in time. This
resulted in having a game that was finished without having to crunch. As part of the project,
we were also required to make a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/959559550/1035666030?token=30f776e9">Kickstarter which can be found here</a>.
