**Game Description**  
Inside Bob is about a janitor cleaning up inside a body. The game is a platformer, where
the player can set his own jump pads. Using these, the player must gather the medicine,
and remove any disease left over from previous infections. 

**Project Description**  
The game was made by 6 people on my first semester of my masters in Game Design for the course
'Making Games'. It was made over 8 weeks, from first pitch to final polish. The game was
designed using tools such as brainstorming, prototyping in Unity and design documents.
Producing this game was an exercise in teamwork, considering the vast difference in
backgrounds each member brought to the team.

The game can be downloaded <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zU2Qn-OXSYOLJThX91x_1HAx_u11a3SD/view?usp=share_link">here</a> and is
