**Game Description**  
Smadreland Simulator can be roughly translated from Danish to "Destructionland Simulator",
which is exactly what it implies. It's a game about destroying as many things as possible,
as quickly as possible. Objects such as old cars and washing machines fall from the sky, and
weapons fall out of them when destroyed (You don't store your weapons in your washing
machine?) At the end, the devil appears and you have to beat him.

**Project Description**  
The game was the winner of a gamejam organized by [Copenhell](https://www.copenhell.dk/), the biggest danish hard rock and metal festival</a> with more than 20.000
attendees. I got together with 3 other guys and we set out to make the game. We knew we
would be right next to the real Smadreland at the festival (yes, it exists!). It's a pretty
iconic thing for Copenhell, who wouldn't want to take a giant sledgehammer to town on a car?
However, there
is an age limit, so we decided to make a virtual version of this. Since Smadreland was not
in the virtual world, we could add more extreme things, such as flamethrowers and
explosions. Furthermore, we assumed that the average festival goer was not a gamer, so we
made the game simple, with simple controls and systems. This was also because we didn't
expect them to play for more than a few minutes, so having a game that's easy to learn was
important. As it was so short, hard to master wasn't a goal we aimed for.

**How To Get It**  
The game can be found [here](https://onkelerik.itch.io/smadreland-simulator-2018) and is
played with controllers. The game was also showed off at Copenhell, having a few hundred players who
enjoyed it tremendously.
